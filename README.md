##Hydra* and Finder*  
Algorithms for batch POD discovery.
We implement Hydra* (resp. Finder*) by hydra (resp. DCFinder) : [metanome-algorithms](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/metanome-algorithms).  
Hydra (resp. DCFinder) have been implemented by student(s) of the information systems group at the Hasso-Plattner-Institut (HPI) in the context of the Metanome project. The copyright of hydra* (resp. finder*) belongs to autor(s) of hydra (resp. DCFinder).

dataset: Data sets.

IncPOD: the incremental POD discovery algorithm in paper.pdf.

All algorithms encode string objects to integer objects. You must put tuples in data set D and data set △D in one data set.  
number n: the number of tuples in data set D  
number m: the number of tuples in data set △D  
double l: the parameter "l" in paper Section 5 Algorithm 3. Default setting: l=0.6.  

You may change code or parameter "l" as needed to fit your own data.
